# bitcointalkThreadFilter
 
This script is for Greasemonkey/Tempermonkey. Just adding "DEL" buttons next to thread title to delete simply. If you mistakenly deleted the thread, then you can recover it from "RECOVERY" button upperside. 
The purpose is not ignoring useful threads but sometimes ICO ANN threads are really hard to find new things without seeing known threads. This is GENERAL script, please use it for unnecessary threads only.

* Feature
** DEL: Remove from your display that thread
** RECOVERY: Recover deleted thread to show
** [TEXTBOX]: Filter by entered strings
** DeleteThem: Remove filtered threads. For instance typing "Airdrop" and Click this button, then all threads with named "Airdrop" will be removed in that page.
